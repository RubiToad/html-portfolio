<h2>Active Projects</h2>
<h3>Dine in Dungeon</h3>
<p>This is a fantasy, cooking game where you cook using the strange produce and monsters found in a fantasy dungeon. I've been working on it over the summer
  with two friends, and we're aiming for a 2025 release!

<h3>2024 Web Development Bootcamp</h3>
<p>I'm currently enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp. In this course I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a number of other
  front-end development skills! This is another summer project of mine to help me on my way to becoming a full-stack developer.

<h1>Tyler's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Just a small list of some of my favorite movies</h2>

<h3>Trilogies</h3>
<h4>Back to the Future</h4>
<p>This series is, in my opinion, the perfect trilogy. The three movies reference each other consistently, show character growth, role reversal, 
    and goofy script writing. I love the characters, the plot, the action, and the rewatchability.
</p>

<h4>Men in Black</h4>
<p>Funny alien movies that I often rewatch. Will Smith does a great job, and the aliens are interesting.</p>

<h4>Spiderverse</h4>
<p>Please let part 3 come out soon! Spiderverse is my favorite rendition of the spiderman movies. They are charming, have a wide, varied cast of characters,
     and have a great sense of humour.

<h3>Mysteries</h3>
<h4>Clue</h4>
<p>The classic murder mystery. Hilarious writing and iconic soundtrack.</p>

<h4>Knives Out</h4>
<p>An intriguing spin on the classic murder mystery. It left me suspenseful in the first half of the movie, and shocked in the second half.</p>
